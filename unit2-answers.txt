## Socket Programming General True or False Statements
# Question 'ab': True or false: The accept() function for the C programming languagf e accepts all waiting network sockets each time it is called.
ab=f // It accepts connections but only one at a time within the queue. So i assume this is what is meant by it. It doesnt accept all at the same time
# Question 'ac': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language can be called by either the initiator or receiver of a socket connection.
ac=t
# Question 'ad': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language cannot be called on connection-less sockets.
ad=t
# Question 'ae': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can result in a `broken pipe' condition.
ae=f
# Question 'af': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language can be used to write data to a socket.
af=t
# Question 'ag': True or false: The socket() function for the C programming language sets the address of a network socket
ag=t
# Question 'ah': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language is used to write the address information into a socket.
ah=f
# Question 'ai': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language normally requires the network address, but not any layer 4 address of the target.
ai=t
# Question 'aj': True or false: The close() function for the C programming language closes a server's socket and all open connections created by that socket.
aj=f
# Question 'ak': True or false: A network socket usually contains addressing information for layer 3 and layer 4
ak=t
# Question 'al': True or false: The send() function for the C programming language can be used to write data to a connection-oriented socket.
al=f
# Question 'am': True or false: The bind() function for the C programming language connects a network address to a network address
am=t
# Question 'an': True or false: The connect() function for the C programming language is used by a client to connect to a server
an=t
# Question 'ao': True or false: The recv() function for the C programming language normally waits for data to arrive, if none is waiting.
ao=f
# Question 'ap': True or false: The write() function for the C programming language is used to reply to a read() request from a server.
