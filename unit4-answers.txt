Cryptographic hash functions are unique mathematical equation formulas used to disguise or encrypt sensitive information. Commonly used within the e-commerce industry to protect sensitive consumer details when making payments. Cryptographic hash functions conceal information like credit card details during the data transfer process to deter hackers from gaining sensitive information. In recent times cryptography has been used in blockchain systems. Hashing in cryptocurrency is extremely vital in protecting one’s information, as hacking within the crypto world is common. Widely used hashing functions include: Secure hashing algorithm (SHA-2 and SHA-3), message digest algorithm (MD5) and BLAKE2. Each of these hashing functions work with different algorithms to produce separate outputs. However, its not uncommon for people to use multiple hashing functions to encrypt sensitive data. These hashing functions are selectively used depending on what data needs to be encrypted. For hashing data and certificate files SHA2 is used due to its unique output with every data string. Whereas, for vulnerable passwords bcrypt is widely used due to its ability to scale with computing power. However, using pre-dated hash functions can result in serious security vulnerabilities. Brute force attacks and attacks using probabilistic algorithms can break old hashing functions like SHA1. But nowadays it is very uncommon to see newer hash functions being exploited due to the serious complexity of algorithms and collision resistants.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure is an updated version of the previous HTTP staple formerly used. The secure protocol was implemented to use TSL to encrypt HTTP requests and replies. Meaning it was far more secure as user data was fully encrypted, and hackers were unable to sniff internet traffic. However, malicious sites commonly do not implement HTTPS or disguise that it is. For this reason, the popular browser ‘Firefox’ introduced the HTTPS-Only Mode. This mode can be extremely handy to ensure security when entering passwords, or any type of sensitive information within a website. Some people unfortunately fall victim to eavesdropping attacks which was the main motive for Firefox to introduce a mode like this.
